Simple Question Web App
===

###Ruby on Rails tutorial project 

Project can be accessed at: https://warm-mesa-2628.herokuapp.com/

###Bugs:
-------
1. Generated answers and question topic are linking to an undefined page, resulting in an error.



###Planned future updates:
-------
1. Prevent PostGreSQL DB 'question_id' from auto-incrementing past the value of total number of submitted questions. 


2. Route a link to the index page.
